# Project-Metodi-del-Calcolo-Scientifico

This repository contains the source code and analysis for comparing open-source and proprietary software environments in solving a common problem. The main objective of this project is to derive valuable insights and considerations by comparing the implementation and functionality of the Cholesky method for solving linear systems with sparse, symmetric, and positive definite matrices across different programming environments and operating systems.

## Problem Description
The focus of this project is to examine and compare the implementation and performance of the Cholesky method in MATLAB, a closed-source language requiring a license, and Python, an open-source language with a rich ecosystem of libraries for solving a wide range of problems. Additionally, the project will contrast the execution of the method in both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Project Scope
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond technical aspects and considers trade-offs, performance, effectiveness, managerial considerations, costs, and repercussions associated with choosing one environment over the other. The intention is to simulate a real-world decision-making context and facilitate an informed choice.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have MATLAB and Python installed on your system.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd repository-name
   ```

4. Explore the implementation files (`cholesky.m` and `cholesky.py`) to understand the Cholesky method in both languages.
